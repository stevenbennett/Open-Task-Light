added files to use the neewer tl96 rgb light stick.
space for two 8x3 mm magnets
also created a grid which should direct the light more straigt, but i dont use it as it darkens everything to much, but maybe someone likes it :)
as the light is not the lightes one i also used a bit of felt to increase friction
