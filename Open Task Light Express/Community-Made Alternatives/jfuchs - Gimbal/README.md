# Gimbal end for the DIYson Express

This is a design that adds two more dimensions of control to the DIYson express.
It allows the same Ulanzi lamp recommended for the DIYson express to be mounted
on a gimbal.

## Parts to purchase

On top of the parts for the DIYson express, you will need only one 608ZZ
bearing. They are readily available on Amazon, AliExpress, eBay, and more.

## Printed parts

I've printed these parts in PLA with a 0.2mm layer height and a 0.4mm nozzle
with a max line width of 0.6mm. I have not tried other materials, but I suspect
PETG would work as well. The only challenging material constrait I know of is
that the outer ring has to bend enough to clip around the inner ring.

### Inner ring

The inner ring is a clip that goes around the lamp. It should be oriented so
that it clips around the sides of the lamp, leaving the buttons and the usb port
accessible. The inner ring has two recesses to press-fit in a 6mm⨉2mm ciruclar
magnet. It can be printed without support if printed on its side.

### Outer ring

The outer ring is a clip that goes around the inner ring. I printed it oriented
on its side, with support.

### Extrusion bracket

The extrusion bracket is a bracket that clips around the 2020 extrusion on one
end and receives a 608ZZ bearing on the other. If you print with the bearing
hold facing down, I was able to print it without support, but it did require
some bridging inside the hole (which will be hidden after assembly).

## Assembly

1. Press-fit the bearing around the post on the outer ring. I found a clamp or a
   vice will help with this.
2. Press-fit the bearing into the extrusion bracket. Again, a clamp may help —
   but you might need a spacer block inside the bracket to avoid crushing the
   tabs that fit around the extrusion.
3. Screw the extrusion bracket to the extrusion using the same Open Builds M5 x
   8mm low profile screws and M5 T-nuts as the rest of the DIYson Express.
4. Press-fit the two magnets into the inner ring. You may want to check the
   magnets against the lamp to make sure you get the polarity right. A clamp may
   help.
5. Clip the inner ring around the lamp.
6. Bend the outer ring just enough to fit it around the inner ring.
