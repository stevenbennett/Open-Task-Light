# DIYson Express
The DIYson express is the more approachable, completely customizable variant of the DIYson project. The Express is constructed from a simplified parts list which includes an out-of-the-box lighting and electronics solution. Check out the project video for a full overview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv9rY6r6liI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv9rY6r6liI)

Sometimes the hardware costs can really add up, especially if you don't have the smaller M2 and M3 screws already on hand. For example; the M2 and M3 screw assortment normally costs $15.99USD, but the Express only requires 8 of them. That's about $2USD per screw. No good. To help with this, I put together a "Hardware Booster Kit" which includes the highest cost-per-part components and can help reduce costs by up to $50USD. Check it out here: [https://stevenbennett.gumroad.com/l/vseqv](https://stevenbennett.gumroad.com/l/vseqv) (note that you will still need a bunch of components found in the parts list, but all of them have a more reasonable cost-per-part and/or are logistically difficult for me to include in this kit).
